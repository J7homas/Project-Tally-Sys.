# Project-Tally-Sys.

The Project Tally System is a comprehensive program designed to track and manage weekly projects. It allows users to log their completed projects, which are stored in a MySQL database. The program displays the total number of projects and their completion status, offering a clear overview of progress. Additionally, users can update project details, including completion confirmations, with all changes being automatically reflected in the database. This system streamlines project tracking and ensures accurate, up-to-date records.

To view the code and try it out go to the Master branch.
